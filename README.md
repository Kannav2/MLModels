# Machine Learning Models Project

A modular Python project containing three popular machine learning algorithms: **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **Random Forest**. Each model is implemented in a separate file with comprehensive documentation, making it easy to understand, modify, and integrate into your projects.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Test Individual Models

Each model can be tested independently:

```bash
# Test XGBoost model
python xgboost_model.py

# Test LightGBM model
python lightgbm_model.py

# Test Random Forest model
python random_forest_model.py
```

### 3. Import and Use 

```python
from xgboost_model import get_model as get_xgboost
from lightgbm_model import get_model as get_lightgbm
from random_forest_model import get_model as get_random_forest

# Initialize models
xgb_model = get_xgboost()
lgb_model = get_lightgbm()
rf_model = get_random_forest()

# Train with your data
# xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# predictions = xgb_model.predict(X_test)
```

## üìà When to Use Each Model

### Use **XGBoost** when:

- You're participating in ML competitions
- You need the highest possible accuracy
- You have structured/tabular data
- You can afford longer training times for better performance

### Use **LightGBM** when:

- You have large datasets (>100K samples)
- Training speed is critical
- You're deploying to production
- You have many categorical features
- Memory usage is a concern

### Use **Random Forest** when:

- You need a reliable baseline model
- Interpretability is important
- You want to understand feature importance
- You have limited time for hyperparameter tuning
- You're working with mixed data types

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Guide

### Adding Your Data

1. **Replace placeholder data loading**:

   ```python
   # In any model file, replace:
   # X, y = load_data()  # Your data loading function

   # With your actual data loading:
   X = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
   y = X.pop('target_column')
   ```

2. **Implement preprocessing**:

   ```python
   def preprocess_data(X, y=None):
       # Add your preprocessing steps
       X = X.fillna(X.mean())  # Handle missing values
       # Add feature engineering, scaling, etc.
       return X, y
   ```

3. **Customize hyperparameters**:
   ```python
   def get_model():
       model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
           n_estimators=200,        # Increase for better performance
           learning_rate=0.05,      # Lower for more precise learning
           # Add your custom parameters
       )
       return model
   ```

### Model Comparison

```python
from xgboost_model import get_model as get_xgboost, train_model as train_xgb
from lightgbm_model import get_model as get_lightgbm, train_model as train_lgb
from random_forest_model import get_model as get_rf, train_model as train_rf

# Initialize models
models = {
    'XGBoost': get_xgboost(),
    'LightGBM': get_lightgbm(),
    'RandomForest': get_rf()
}

# Train and compare
results = {}
for name, model in models.items():
    # Train model (implement your training logic)
    # trained_model = train_model(model, X_train, y_train)
    # results[name] = evaluate_model(trained_model, X_test, y_test)
    pass
```

## üìö Documentation

Each model has detailed documentation explaining:

- **Code walkthrough**: Line-by-line explanation of the implementation
- **Theory**: How the algorithm works under the hood
- **Use cases**: When and why to use each model
- **Hyperparameters**: Detailed explanation of key parameters
- **Integration tips**: How to modify and extend the code

Read the documentation files:

- [`xgboost_model.md`](xgboost_model.md) - XGBoost theory and usage
- [`lightgbm_model.md`](lightgbm_model.md) - LightGBM theory and usage
